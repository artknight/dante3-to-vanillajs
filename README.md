# dante3-to-vanillajs

---

### Setup Instructions
1. run `yarn install` to get everything installed
2. run `webpack` to generate `dist/app.dante3.js` file
3. double-click on the `public/index.html` to load the editor


### Pre-text
I have created `webpack.config.js` to generate the `app.dante3.js` file that is supposed to contain everything needed to be run in vanilla JS.


### Issues
There are several errors in the console that need to be resolved.
